        <h2 id="titulo2">Benefits of diet<br> and gym exercises</h2>
        <h3>How does diet help people of all ages in different types of lives or years?</h3>
        <p class="texto">
            Diet is the set of foods consumed by a person that constitute their nutritional behavior. 
            A balanced diet must contain the correct amount of food to meet nutritional needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Good nutrition is essential for performance in the gym. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins aid muscle recovery, 
            and healthy fats are important for hormonal health. Hydration should occur before, during and after training, with sports 
            drinks during prolonged activities. Planning pre- and post-workout meals and preparing healthy options in advance are 
            valuable strategies. Supplements like protein powder and creatine can help you achieve goals.

        <h3 id="segundosubtitulo">The importance of exercising</h3>
        <p class="texto">
            Exercise at the gym is important for different types of ages. Physical exercise improves health and physical fitness, offering 
            benefits such as cardiovascular resistance, muscle strengthening and mental well-being. Regular practice, combined with a balanced 
            diet, is essential for health.
            <br>
            <br>
            Strength training is crucial for weight loss and toning, increasing muscle mass and metabolism. Cardiovascular exercises, such as running 
            and HIIT, are important for health and fat burning. Flexibility, worked on with stretching, prevents injuries. A balanced routine should divide 
            muscle groups and include variations. Rest is key to recovery, with massage and adequate sleep being helpful techniques.
